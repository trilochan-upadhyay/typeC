# typeC

**typeC** is a browser-based C compiler and runtime environment that allows you to write, compile, and execute C programs directly from your browser—no installation required.  

This project was created as part of my learning journey in C programming. In my first semester of **Bachelors**, I faced a problem: the computers in our lab are old, often throw compiler errors, and run different operating systems, making it difficult to practice C consistently.  

To solve this, I decided to create **typeC**—an environment for myself to code C smoothly in the browser, although there are similar tools out there. Think of it as my personal solution that could help others facing the same issues! 😅
